## Datasets extraction

In this directory, we have only added the `LDA best model file` and the initial name of the `artist page names` that were liked by LikeYouth participants on Facebook. 
To get access to artists' lyrics and the lyrics' content features, please download the data as a `zip file` from the [Lyrics_annotated_data](https://osf.io/kftqr/files/osfstorage) hosted on [OSF](https://osf.io/kftqr/files/osfstorage) directory. When cloning/downloading the repo, add the `.csv files` into this directory to re-run the experiments we describe here. When using the initial `artist_lyrics_initial_dt.csv` and re-running the scripts we have provided here, you should be able to reproduce the `artist_lyrics_annot_vader_nrc_moralStrength_lda_final_dt.csv`.
